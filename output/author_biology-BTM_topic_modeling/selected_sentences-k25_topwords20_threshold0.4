648	0.42917073999999994	21 10 20	Thus, for atoms and subatomic particles (and for molecules, too), we use a unit of measurement called the dalton, in honor of John Dalton, the British scientist who helped develop atomic theory around 1800.

654	0.41795326	21 20 10	This number of protons, which is unique to that element, is called the atomic number and is written as a subscript to the left of the symbol for the element.
657	0.43682519999999997	21 12 20	Therefore, the atomic number tells us the number of protons and also the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom.

5261	0.40980711	18 21 4	Remarkably, Mendel made this deduction without knowing about the role, or even the existence, of chromosomes.
5262	0.4214983	18 23 0	Recall from Chapter 13 that each somatic cell in a diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent.
5263	0.45625367	18 11 23	Thus, a genetic locus is actually represented twice in a diploid cell, once on each homolog of a specific pair of chromosomes.
5264	0.40301762	18 11 7	The two alleles at a particular locus may be identical, as in the true-breeding plants of Mendels P generation.
5267	0.46161278999999994	18 23 11	Accordingly, Mendels F 1 plants had purple flowers because the allele for that trait is dominant and the allele for white flowers is recessive.
5269	0.44499884	18 11 21	Thus, an egg or a sperm gets only one of the two alleles that are present in the somatic cells of the organism making the gamete.

5273	0.45137467	18 11 13	In our example, P is the purple-flower allele, and p is the white-flower allele; the gene itself is sometimes referred to as the P/p gene.
5276	0.41797446000000005	18 23 11	One-half of the F 2 offspring have inherited one purple-flower allele and one white-flower allele; these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait.
5279	0.44913196	18 11 13	An organism that has a pair of identical alleles for a character is said to be homozygous for the gene controlling that character.
5280	0.42964004999999994	18 14 11	In the parental generation in Figure 14.5, the purple pea plant is homozygous for the dominant allele (PP), while the white plant is homozygous for the recessive allele (pp).

5302	0.4145337	18 14 5	We cannot tell from its flower color if this plant is homozygous (PP) or heterozygous (Pp) because both genotypes result in the same purple phenotype.
5303	0.46890193	18 23 16	To determine the genotype, we can cross this plant with a white-flowered plant (pp), which will make only gametes with the recessive allele (p).
5304	0.496913702	18 11 3	The allele in the gamete contributed by the mystery plant will therefore determine the appearance of the offspring .
5305	0.44000111999999997	18 23 13	If all the offspring of the cross have purple flowers, then the purpleflowered mystery plant must be homozygous for the dominant allele, because a PP  pp cross produces all Pp offspring.
5306	0.41456021000000004	18 9 21	But if both the purple and the white phenotypes appear among the offspring, then the purple-flowered parent must be heterozygous.
5310	0.42351927	18 0 9	Mendel derived the law of segregation from experiments in which he followed only a single character, such as flower color.

5375	0.44080302	18 20 13	For a particular F 2 plant to have wrinkled seeds, the recessive trait, both the egg and the sperm that come together must carry the r allele.
5377	0.464880815	18 7 11	Thus, the multiplication rule tells us that the probability of an F 2 plant having wrinkled seeds (rr) is  ( , on the next page).
5378	0.40833820000000004	18 0 9	Likewise, the probability of an F 2 plant carrying both dominant alleles for seed shape (RR) is  .
5379	0.481655722	18 0 11	To figure out the probability that an F 2 plant from a monohybrid cross will be heterozygous rather than homozygous, we need to invoke a second rule.

16520	0.41873127	2 22 24	Like a home heating system, an animal achieves homeostasis by maintaining a variable, such as body temperature or solute concentration, at or near a particular value, or set point.
16523	0.44006952	2 0 20	In the home heating example, a drop in temperature below the set point acts as a stimulus, the thermostat serves as the sensor and control center, and the heater produces the response.

17497	0.44643372	24 20 2	The walls of arteries are thick and strong, accommodating blood pumped at high pressure by the heart.
17498	0.42130153	24 5 14	Arterial walls also have an elastic recoil that helps maintain blood pressure and flow to capillaries when the heart relaxes between contractions.
17499	0.44040549	24 14 5	Signals from the nervous system and hormones circulating in the blood act on the smooth muscle in arteries and arterioles, dilating or constricting these vessels and thus controlling blood flow to different parts of the body.
17500	0.42509419	24 5 19	Because veins convey blood back to the heart at a lower pressure, they do not require thick walls.
