637	0.446634072	21 20 12	For example, the symbol C stands for both the element carbon and a single carbon atom.
646	0.42274732	21 0 10	The neutron and proton are almost identical in mass, each about 1.7   10 24 gram (g).
647	0.44514046	21 20 9	Grams and other conventional units are not very useful for describing the mass of objects so minuscule.
648	0.42917073999999994	21 10 20	Thus, for atoms and subatomic particles (and for molecules, too), we use a unit of measurement called the dalton, in honor of John Dalton, the British scientist who helped develop atomic theory around 1800.
652	0.42668671	21 20 3	Atoms of the various elements differ in their number of subatomic particles.
657	0.43682519999999997	21 12 20	Therefore, the atomic number tells us the number of protons and also the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom.
658	0.44481723	21 10 9	We can deduce the number of neutrons from a second quantity, the mass number, which is the sum of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.

747	0.44138394	21 0 20	In the case of lithium, there is only 1 valence electron, and the second shell is the valence shell.

771	0.495214574	21 20 12	The reactivity of atoms arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in one or more orbitals of their valence shells.

16528	0.44735986	2 22 19	Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium, the interplay between external factors that tend to change the internal environment and internal control mechanisms that oppose such changes.
16529	0.4944707232	2 10 14	Note that physiological responses to stimuli are not instantaneous, just as switching on a furnace does not immediately warm a room.
16535	0.44890204	2 10 24	Positive-feedback loops in animals do not play a major role in homeostasis, but instead help drive processes to completion.
16553	0.42244139999999997	22 2 19	As the animal acclimatizes, changes in kidney function result in excretion of more alkaline urine, returning blood pH to its normal range.
16586	0.4665455	22 9 4	In a hot environment, endothermic vertebrates have mechanisms for cooling their bodies, enabling them to withstand heat loads that are intolerable for most ectotherms.
16588	0.42379894999999995	2 22 20	Ectotherms also usually tolerate larger fluctuations in their internal temperature.
16589	0.471829872	2 24 15	Although ectotherms do not generate enough heat for thermoregulation, many adjust body temperature by behavioral means, such as seeking out shade or basking in the sun  .
16594	0.43110938	22 2 9	For example, the largemouth bass is a poikilotherm, and the river otter is a homeotherm (see Figure 40.7).

16631	0.42477662	2 19 22	It is vasoconstriction in blood vessels of the ear that allows the jackrabbit shown in Figure 40.1 to avoid overheating on hot desert days.
16635	0.4244562	2 22 24	In many birds and mammals, reducing heat loss from the body relies on countercurrent exchange, the transfer of heat (or solutes) between fluids that are flowing in opposite directions.
16647	0.45488753	2 15 7	Many mammals and birds live in places where thermoregulation requires cooling as well as warming.
16653	0.4489049	2 23 4	Some birds have a pouch richly supplied with blood vessels in the floor of the mouth; fluttering the pouch increases evaporation.
16674	0.45603624	10 20 2	Because endotherms generally maintain a body temperature considerably higher than that of the environment, they must counteract continual heat loss.
16675	0.43640724	20 10 18	Endotherms can vary heat productionthermogenesisto match changing rates of heat loss.
16729	0.47509369000000007	13 18 4	Food is digested by enzymatic hydrolysis (see Figure 5.2b), and nutrients are absorbed by body cells.

16742	0.42477624999999997	2 10 20	Metabolic rate can be determined in several ways.
16763	0.49990765756	21 12 4	In fact, for even more varied organisms ranging in size from bacteria to blue whales, metabolic rate remains roughly proportional to body mass to the three-quarter power (m ).
16772	0.45306976	22 2 23	As body size becomes smaller, each gram of tissue increases in energy cost.
16859	0.42066973999999996	11 4 23	Some nutrients are essential for all animals, whereas others are needed only by certain species.

17022	0.42872847999999997	20 15 21	During swallowing, the tongue provides further help, pushing the bolus to the back of the oral cavity and into the pharynx.
17050	0.43290872	24 15 7	The answer is that the ingredients of gastric juice are kept inactive until they are released into the lumen (cavity) of the stomach.
17078	0.4355347	2 20 24	The contents of the stomach typically pass into the small intestine within 26 hours after a meal.

17267	0.44142608	24 5 1	Our ancestors on the African savanna were hunter-gatherers who probably survived mainly on seeds and other plant products, a diet only occasionally supplemented by hunting game or scavenging meat from animals killed by other predators.
17288	0.43452819	24 7 15	The reddish color and branching structure of the axolotls gills reflect the intimate association between exchange and transport.

17295	0.479504091	24 4 7	We will explore the remarkable variation in form and organization of these systems by considering examples from a number of species.
17297	0.44112862999999997	24 15 22	The molecular trade that an animal carries out with its environmentgaining O 2 and nutrients while shedding CO 2 and other waste productsmust ultimately involve every cell in the body.
17298	0.46033401	24 5 14	As you learned in Chapter 7, small, nonpolar molecules such as O 2 and CO 2 can move between cells and their immediate surroundings by diffusion.
17306	0.45304279	24 20 12	Each cell can thus exchange materials directly with the surrounding medium.
17308	0.45810052999999995	24 2 5	The second solution, found in all other animals, is a circulatory system that moves fluid between each cells immediate surroundings and the tissues where exchange with the environment occurs.
17309	0.47276689	24 4 15	Lets begin by looking at animals that lack a distinct circulatory system.
17310	0.42678837000000003	24 4 7	In hydras, jellies, and other cnidarians, a central gastrovascular cavity functions in the distribution of substances throughout the body and in digestion (see Figure 41.7).
17321	0.45246327	24 5 22	In these organisms, a circulatory system minimizes the distances that substances must diffuse to enter or leave a cell.
17324	0.45169922999999995	24 20 2	By transporting fluid throughout the body, the circulatory system functionally connects the aqueous environment of the body cells to the organs that exchange gases, absorb nutrients, and dispose of wastes.
17333	0.495327384	24 5 20	Contraction of one or more hearts pumps the hemolymph through the circulatory vessels into interconnected sinuses, spaces surrounding the organs.

17340	0.4400858	24 22 9	Chemical exchange occurs between the blood and the interstitial fluid, as well as between the interstitial fluid and body cells.
17342	0.42611184	24 3 5	The fact that both open and closed circulatory systems are widespread among animals suggests that there are advantages to each system.
17343	0.42774957999999996	24 22 20	The lower hydrostatic pressures associated with open circulatory systems make them less costly than closed systems in terms of energy expenditure.

17350	0.45075274	24 14 7	The closed circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates is often called the cardiovascular system.
17351	0.46094591	24 5 14	Blood circulates to and from the heart through an amazingly extensive network of vessels: The total length of blood vessels in an average human adult is twice Earths circumference at the equator!

17360	0.4385266	24 14 5	Arteries and veins are distinguished by the direction in which they carry blood, not by the O 2 content or other characteristics of the blood they contain.
17361	0.46579636	24 5 20	Arteries carry blood from the heart toward capillaries, and veins return blood to the heart from capillaries.

17450	0.49819015099999997	10 20 24	However, not all heart murmurs are caused by a defect, and most valve defects do not reduce the efficiency of blood flow enough to warrant surgery.
17459	0.47807348	24 5 14	Because cardiac muscle cells are electrically coupled through gap junctions (see Figure 6.32), impulses from the SA node spread rapidly within heart tissue.

22214	0.44784697	4 11 13	When the male sees and turns toward the female, he relies on visual communication.
22227	0.43064884	4 0 14	As illustrated in  , a returning bee quickly becomes the center of attention for other bees, called followers.
22229	0.42894173999999996	0 9 8	This behavior, called the round dance, motivates the follower bees to leave the hive and search for nearby food.

22432	0.43380794	4 18 11	In summary, there was an observable and interpretable evolutionary change in behavior in the laboratory populations.
22434	0.47472039	4 18 13	This idea proposes that foraging behavior is a compromise between the benefits of nutrition and the costs of obtaining food.
